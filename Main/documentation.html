      <h1> <div class="doc" > 30MFF: </div> <div class="specialwords"> Pride 2020 </div>  </h1> Webpage done by me but the video was in collaboration with Sashank, Katie, Joonha. 

      <h2> Project Description: </h2> 

     This project embodies the theme of Pride, a global movement that celebrates queerness and non-heternormativity and that promotes a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to celebrate their gender identity and their sexuality.

      <h2> Process: </h2>
      My motivation was to create a space that celebrates pride collectively but in the web since we have to stay at home and quearantined this year. That is why the style of the webpage is very texting messages (font) and bubbly like.

      Well, this is my first page so I did a lot of trial and error. I sketched the wireframe first, with the main ideas and content, although I was not very sure what was the best way of displaying content. I started with the home page, the header and the video. 

      <h2> Reflection/Evaluation: </h2>

       In reflection, although not all my expectations were met, I am grateful to have learnt this much in a week. 'Pride 2020' shares a personal love story while it connects it to broader concepts and movements such as the history of pride (that is not as colorful as the pride flag) and its continuos struggles which I wish I could have added to the history of pride page. At the same time, it is very important to me to have the academia section because often, academia and the real world struggles seem not to talk to each other. Academia is the means through which one can find words that express LGBTQ+ experiences, as well as it is necessary to connect academia with real and daily life struggles. That is why, for instance, the Donate page exists.

      Due to my limited abilities and time constraint I changed some features from the pages. For instance, I would have liked to link better the webpages so people understand better the connections among donate and academia. Also, I decided to display 2 out of the 4 selected coun
         tries whose LGBTQ+ communities are represented in the webpage, with the hope that I can research further and make it in the future. So, this is not the final version.

               

      <h1> Comic strip: <div class="specialwords">  Period.s </div>  </h1>
      by Romeno, Saad and Pam.
      <h2> Project Description: </h2>

      <p class="doc">  The purpose of this comic is to normalize the idea of menstruation to children. Until today many women around the world continue to stop their education after they have their first menstruation. It is very important to empower young girls by giving them access to information and resources so they can develop a healthy relationship between their period, their bodies and their self-esteem. Menstruation sounds scary for many people because it is a spoken topic in many cultures. Menstruation is perceived as a taboo in different societies. By creating this project, we are hoping to normalize this topic in our cultures along the lines of introducing the idea for little kids and allowing young girls to express themselves freely. </p>

      <h2> Process: </h2>

     I was inspired by a story that my (Pam) sister wrote (she is a storyteller for kids) so the content (the drawings existed before the idea of making it a comic). So, after deciding what topic we were to develop collectively as the theme is relevant to social issues. We divided tasks but still worked and communicated as a whole during all stages of the project. Romeno and Saad worked on the web development part. Romeno implemented the displaying story, sequence logic & animation of the site. Saad worked on the interactivity of the website which included the implementation of the svg hover sound effects, cursor change, and in addition the speed optimization. Pam worked on illustrator, the design features, and redrew all of the images on illustrator .

      We decided to make it simplistic and friendly to welcome audiences from different ages to explore menstruation. We wanted the user experience and animations to be as smooth as possible so the viewer could focus on the story. To add to the story we were trying to tell, we thought it would be an important part to add sound effects, just to make the user be able to not only visualize what's happening but also listen to it and feel what the character is experiencing (Pain sound, heart rate, blood dripping, typing, clock…). 

      <h2> Reflection/Evaluation: </h2>
       We are very happy about this project and its accessibility by making it in different languages. We would have liked to make it more responsive for smartphone devices as for now it is only responsive for any desktop / laptop resolution.



       <h1> Sound Journey:<div class="specialwords">  Cuyagua </div>  </h1>


       by Zunair, Yusra and Pam.

   <h2> Project Description: </h2>

The purpose of this project is to keep a place alive and accessible through the possibilities of the web. This is an interactive web that provides a journey to Cuyagua through an auditory experience. In the main page you will find the visual map with different stations (points/numbers) with which you can interact and learn more about this hidden place in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. It is a mix of both languages, English and Spanish since the people who narrate the experience are mostly spanish-speaking (all except me, the translator). While the main audience might seem to be English speaking people (and that is why we have provided an English script), we tried to the best of our abilities to provide access to spanish- speaking people by translating some parts of the page, such as the about page. If we have had more time, perhaps we could have translated the whole web so spanish speaking people could also fill out the contact form!

 <h2> Process: </h2>

This page is in honor to the people of Cuyagua; to the place that gave me the greatest memories of my childhood; to the place that made me fall in love with nature, drums and my own Afro Venezuelan cultural heritage. I had footage from this place that my sister and I recorded in 2014 so in addition to a couple of questions that I asked to several family members I developed the script of a journey that divided itself in 6 parts: the road, the town, the house, the food, the beach and the reality (on our way back). I focused mostly on sound design. I used original footage such as the interviews of Pablo, Paola, Paul, Adriana, Alberto Papo’s voice as well as my own voice as the translator and dozens (if not hundreds) of sounds taken from freesound.org and youtube. (We are thankful for their existence). It was a long process to gather all the sounds and to organize them in a sequential way. Yusra and Zunair: we worked collectively so the webpage complemented the sound story. We used photoshop to edit the backgrounds, illustrators to design the map and javascript to implement interactivities such as the appearance of the title on the web, the movement of the pins in the map and the appearance of the script. The design thinking process included finding a font that described that adventurous yet mysterious element of the place as well as visual elements that allowed the map, the script and the representation of sound (the wavelength) to exist in the same space. We also made it responsive to smart devices!!

<h2> Reflection/Evaluation: </h2>
We are happy about the product and the process of a collective effort that involves constant communication and respect for each other’s decisions while dividing our tasks. I am personally grateful to have worked with such a hard working team given the huge time constraint.

This project was a dream for me and now it’s materialized. Cuyagua will always be on the web, close to me… until I can come back. Thank you guys!

Something I could have improved is the discrepancy between the words translated and the written script itself in the first two tracks. By the time we got the feedback I had already all of the translation recordings and I decided to proceed and finish the remaining 4 tracks which have an improved mixing between the translation and the interviewed voices. I could have changed the script but in respect of other people’s words I decided to keep it as close as I could from the original message. (You can always choose not to read if it gets confusing!! jk haha).

Given the time constraint we did not change the nature of the script's interactivity as it was suggested by our peers (where we could have highlighted the line being said (very time consuming and we have to be realistic) or hidden the transcript so only people who need it would access to it. This solution seems more time accessible. This weekend we will work on it! (in this very moment we are preparing for project 4).

            <h1> Film: <div class="specialwords">  Mr. Miyagi's, Was It You?</div>  </h1>
 by Joonha, Tonya, Beethoven and Pam.
  <h2> Project Description: </h2>

The purpose of this project is to offer a platform through which one can rethink the ways in which we perceive sexual harassment. This is an interactive web that provides a fictional short film with conventions of crime dramas that portrays the normalized act of sexual harassment but through a non-conventional story. By breaking stereotypes about the victim and the perpetrator but nevertheless still existent on ‘conventional spaces’ where sexual harassment takes place, we invite the audience to engage by listening to the victim’s story while trying to find the perpetrator. More importantly, besides raising the importance of listening to the victim, this film treats sexual harassment as a case of a serious and iminent crime. The interactive elements of our web page allows the audience to question their experiences, learn about it through the resources section and reflect upon the theme by ending with a small quiz.

 <h2> Process: </h2>
This page is to raise awareness about an issue that happens often on campus and outside of the NYUAD community. The target audience is the NYUAD community given the relatability of the location chosen, which is a common club students go to, and other small hints such as the nyuad campus on the resources section. Joonha did an amazing job on the architecture and engineering of the web page in terms of responsiveness and interactivity! Amazing responsiveness (I am sorry okay, it is very exciting!!)

Tonya worked on the wireframe layout/ design. She used photoshop and her amazing searching skills to merge features that would respond to our theme, such as the party type font and darker colors). We constantly communicated to discuss certain aesthetic features. Beethoven worked on the resources section.


I think our short film is fairly good given the time constraints assigned to us to shoot on a weekend!

In this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQgYoX8sjahwgVfL_Gxs0Xqm2cOt3xLw?usp=sharing" >link </a> you can access the archive of the shooting process itself: the script, the production, the storyboard and the shots order excel sheet as well. Most of the shots are originally filmed by us, except a couple of them (the establishing shots) that we got from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/"> pexels </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> youtube </a> All of us acted in the film (even Joonha who did not visually appear). I am grateful I have friends who helped us with the production and scene prompts. Thank you Emilia, Lucas, and Anushka. Anant Singh is not part of this class but he was of great help as he was the cinematographer.

<h2> Reflection/Evaluation: </h2>

Although I wasn't very excited about the script we chose because it needed a lot of work in terms of development as well as I had to do a completely new storyboard, as well I think the film lacked a bit of depth about the psyche of the characters(there were many), but unavoidably this happened as a result of the creative constraint of trying not to exceed the 6min length. Furthermore, I knew it was going to be difficult to make it a realistic depiction of a club, given the limited budget and lack of mobility. However, I actually think it became really powerful to show that these events happen in a recognizable space such as dorms, because this also happens on campus. I wish we could have explore the psychological consequences of sexual assault for the victims as well as depicting the correlation between mental health (example childhood traumas) and the motives of the perpetrator, as well as to have provided more in depth analysis between male gaze, patriarchal structures even in non-heteronormative spaces(because as you saw in the film sexual harassment also happens among the same genders!!!!) . For the next film it will be!
