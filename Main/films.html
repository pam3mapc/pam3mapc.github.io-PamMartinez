   		<p> <br> This is the first film I have done by following a storyboard. <a href= "https://odvixn.github.io/projects/project_4/index.html" > Mr. Miyagi's, Was it You? (2020) </a> is a fictional film that explores sexual harrassment and, therefore, the neglect of consent as a societal crime. </p>

         <p> I have some other stuff on youtube, but it's not that serious. </p>

            <p class="specialwords"> (!!!) </p> celebrates Pride this year (2020). A webpage that shares a short story of a quarantined love, but that also shares relevant resources for the LGBTQ+ community and people who are interested in learning more about Gender identity from an academic perspective. </p>

   	<p>	More about love to come... </p>
