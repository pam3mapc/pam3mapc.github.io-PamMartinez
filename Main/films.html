   		<p> <br> This is the first film I have done by following a storyboard. <a href= "https://odvixn.github.io/projects/project_4/index.html" > Mr. Miyagi's, Was it You? (2020) </a> is a fictional film that explores sexual harrassment and, therefore, the neglect of consent as a societal crime. </p>

         <p> I have some other stuff on <a href= "https://youtu.be/ay9MV336V68">  youtube </a>, but it's not that serious. </p>
